## ✉️ Postman

Sometimes maintining Postman collection up to date can become really painful...

This project comes with an automated script to generate all the Postman collection

The `postmanConfig` object located at `@/src/config/index.ts` must be kept up to date with your API in order to generate the config file correctly

Please open a terminal and run the following command:

```bash
yarn generate-postman-collection
```

You will see a `collection.json` file created at the root of the project.

You simply have to import it in the Postman application, and then you will be ready to test your API on Postman 🚀
